Before running locally for the first time, do the following steps:
	I. activate virtual environment with the following terminal commands (for windows):
		1.`cd venv/Scripts`
		2.`activate.bat`
		(3.`cd ../../` to get back to original location)
	II. run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required modules

Once these steps have been executed, continue by executing main.py.
